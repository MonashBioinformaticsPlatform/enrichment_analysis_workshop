      <description>SH-SY5Y is a widely-used neuroblastoma cell line. With approriate treatment, they can be readily differentiated from their base state into a more neuronal phenotype.
In their paper Transcriptomic Profiling Discloses Molecular and Cellular Events Related to Neuronal Differentiation in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells Pezzini et al induced differentiation of the SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma cell line and measured transcriptomic changes via RNAseq (Pezzini et al. 2017).
