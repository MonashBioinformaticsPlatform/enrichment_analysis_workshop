      <description>Link to open toy enrichment calculator.
This calculates enrichment for a single hypothetical genelist (e.g. your RNAseq differentially expressed genelist) against a single hypothetical &amp;lsquo;term&amp;rsquo; (some set of interesting genes, e.g. synaptic signaling genes). It makes a Venn diagram and a wordy description of what is being tested.
You can adjust various factors and see their effect on the enrichment p-values.
 Note: This is just a toy calculator for this training, it quite limited.</description>

      <description>SH-SY5Y Differentiation SH-SY5Y is a commonly used neuroblastoma cell line. With appropriate treatment, it can be induced to differentiate into a ‘more neuronal’ form. Differentiated cells look quite different, growing thin neurites out from the body of the cell.
Image is derived from Figure 4 (Pezzini et al. 2017)
The question: What pathways are involved in SH-SY5Y Differentiation? In their paper Transcriptomic Profiling Discloses Molecular and Cellular Events Related to Neuronal Differentiation in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells Pezzini et al induced differentiation of the SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma cell line and measured transcriptomic changes via RNAseq (Pezzini et al.</description>

      <title>Defining the genelist</title>

      <description>Starting from those differential expression results here, how do we go about getting a genelist to calculate enrichment on?
Activities  Download the full table of data from degust. Import into excel. Import --
 How many genes are differentially expressed? In these results the FDR Column contains the corrected p-value, and the &amp;lsquo;differentiated&amp;rsquo; column shows the log2 fold-change of differentiated cells vs untreated cells (log2(diff)-log2(undiff)). 0 is unchanged.</description>

      <title>Enrichment Tools</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the small 168-gene set for all these enrichment tools. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have them already, they are available here:
As gene symbols (CD2, DLG4 e.t.c).
 168-gene differentially expressed gene list Background list  As ensemble gene ids (e.g. ENSG00000183654). Harder to read, but some tools need unambiguous IDs like this for performance reasons when working with larger geneslists; e.g. PANTHER or DAVID background or STRING without a specified organism.</description>

      <description>The following tools might be useful for downstream functional analysis; this includes some not covered in todays workshop.
Note that most of these tools do more than just enrichment tests, and some include their own databases.
g:Profiler / g:GOSt https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost
The g:GOSt &amp;lsquo;functional profiling&amp;rsquo; tool of g:Profiler calculates It has a clean modern interface and a handy summary of which genes contribute to the enrichment.
PANTHER http://www.pantherdb.org/
PANTHER performs overrepresentation tests across multiple databases; Gene ontology, reactome, PANTHER pathways and protein classes.</description>

      <description>Dr Dodge&amp;rsquo;s Experiment There&amp;rsquo;s quite a few ways you can calculate functional enrichment - so there&amp;rsquo;s always a risk of p-hacking, whether accidental or deliberate.
So lets go deliberate&amp;hellip;
Dr Dodge is convinced that your experiment should turn out with relevance to GO term &amp;lsquo;segmentation&amp;rsquo; - but p=0.06! But they must be significant, the paper needs be submitted by Friday!
What hacky and statistically questionable approaches could you apply to call these results &amp;ldquo;significant&amp;rdquo;?</description>
