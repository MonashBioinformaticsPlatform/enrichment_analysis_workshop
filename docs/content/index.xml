      <description>SH-SY5Y Differentiation SH-SY5Y is a commonly used neuroblastoma cell line. With appropriate treatment, it can be induced to differentiate into a ‘more neuronal’ form. Differentiated cells look quite different, growing thin neurites out from the body of the cell.

The question: What pathways are involved in SH-SY5Y Differentiation? In their paper Transcriptomic Profiling Discloses Molecular and Cellular Events Related to Neuronal Differentiation in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells Pezzini et al induced differentiation of the SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma cell line and measured transcriptomic changes via RNAseq (Pezzini et al.</description>
