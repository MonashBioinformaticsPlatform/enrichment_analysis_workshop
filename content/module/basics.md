### Overview of enrichment methods
- Types
    - Gene list based
    - Rank Based
    - Network based

    - Over/under representation?
    - Background list
    - Select organism
    - Difference between database and tool and both
- What is GO? A tree.
- Other stats considerations:

    - Importance of background, what is it.
    - Effect of gene list size? What size do you need?

- up genes / down genes => together or separate. (added)
