## Dr Dodge's Experiment

There's quite a few ways you can calculate functional enrichment - so there's always a risk of [p-hacking](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106), wheather accidental or deliberate. 

_So lets go deliberate..._

Dr Dodge is convinced that your experiment should turn out with relevance to GO term 'segmentation' - but p=0.06! But they must be significant, the paper has to be submitted by Friday! 

What hacky and statsticically questionable approaches could you apply to call these results ''significant''?
