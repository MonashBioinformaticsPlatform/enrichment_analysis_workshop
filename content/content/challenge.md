## Dr Dodge's Experiment

There's quite a few ways you can calculate functional enrichment - so there's always a risk of [p-hacking](https://bitesizebio.com/31497/guilty-p-hacking/), whether accidental or deliberate.

What hacky and statistically questionable approaches could you apply to call these results "significant"?
