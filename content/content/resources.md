The following tools might be useful for downstream functional analysis; this includes some not covered in todays workshop. 
Note that most of these tools do more than just enrichment tests.

## g:Profiler / g:GOSt

https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost

The g:GOSt 'functional profiling' tool of g:Profiler calculates 
It has a clean modern interface and a handy summary of which genes contribute to the enrichment.

## PANTHER 

http://www.pantherdb.org/

PANTHER performs overrepresnetation tests across multiple databases; Gene ontology, reactome, PANTHER pathways and protein classes. Allows more control over the statistical test used and clearly summarise what was actually done.

__NB: Enrichment vs overrepresentation test???__

## DAVID 

https://david.ncifcrf.gov/

Via its 'functional annotation' tool, DAVID allows you to calculate functional enrichment across a number of databases ; Gene Ontology, KEGG, reactome and others. Reliable, with a slightly clunky interface.

## Reactome

https://reactome.org/

The core of reactome is the reactome pathways and browser. ALthough other tools use the reactome database, the reactome website provides a means to browse enrichment within the pathway browser view.

## STRINGdb

https://string-db.org/

STRING is not a functional enrichment tool, rather it is a convenient way to explore interactions within a genelist. Results are viewed as an interaction network. Best suited to smaller genelists.

## Biocyc

https://biocyc.org/

Biocyc is another suite of tools for enrichment and pathway browsing, which is useful for prokaryotic work. It is licenced, but monash does have a licence.

## Cytoscape

https://cytoscape.org/

Cytoscape is a desktop-based biological network analysis / visualisation tool, rather than a functional enrichment tool (although plugins can change that). It is mentioned here because it is often useful as a next step when you need to create custom figures showing the interactions of an interesting biological pathway.
