## Functional analysis of -Omics data

### General information

The workshop covers the bioinformatics concepts and tools available for interpreting a gene list using gene ontology and pathway information. The workshop focuses on the principles and concepts required for analyzing and conducting functiona and pathway analysis on a gene list from any organism, although focus will be on human and model eukaryotic organisms.

### Course Objectives

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

- Understand basic concepts of functional enrichment analysis;
- Interpret enrichment analysis results;
- Get systems perspective of gene functions;
- Get more information about a gene list;
- Discover what pathways are enriched in a gene list (and use it for hypothesis generation);
- Predict gene function and extend a gene list;
- Able to follow workflow after the workshop to conduct their own analysis.

### Target Audience
This workshop is intended for biologists working with ‘Omics data’ (e.g. RNA-Seq, protein expression and other omics data), who are interested in interpreting large gene/protein lists resulting from their experiments.

### Setup Requirements
Bring your own laptop with active internet connection. No software installation required as the course will be taught online. Tools and material will be provided on the day.
