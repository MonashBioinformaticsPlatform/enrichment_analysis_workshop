## Functional analysis of -Omics data

### General information

The workshop covers the bioinformatics concepts and tools available for interpreting a gene list using gene ontology and pathway information. The workshop focuses on the principles and concepts required for analyzing and conducting functional and pathway analysis on a gene list from any organism, although the focus will be on human and model eukaryotic organisms.

### Course Objectives

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

- Understand basic concepts of functional enrichment analysis;
- Interpret enrichment analysis results;
- Get systems perspective of gene functions;
- Get more information about a gene list;
- Discover what pathways are enriched in a gene list (and use it for hypothesis generation);
- Predict gene function and extend a gene list;
- Follow workflow after the workshop to conduct their own analysis.

### Target Audience

This workshop is intended for biologists working with ‘-Omics data’ (e.g. RNA-Seq, protein expression and other omics data), who are interested in interpreting large gene/protein lists resulting from their experiments.

### Setup Requirements

This workshop will be delivered online over zoom; you may wish to install the dedicated zoom. Otherwise, no special software installation will required, as we will be using online analysis tools.

Links and material will be provided on the day. BYO coffee.
