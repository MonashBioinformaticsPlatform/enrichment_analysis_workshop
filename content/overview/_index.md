## Functional analysis of -Omics data

### General information

The workshop covers the bioinformatics concepts and tools available for interpreting a gene list using gene ontology and pathway information. The workshop focuses on the principles and concepts required for analyzing and conducting functional and pathway analysis on a gene list from any organism, although the focus will be on human and model eukaryotic organisms.

### Course Objectives

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

- Understand basic concepts of functional enrichment analysis;
- Interpret enrichment analysis results;
- Get systems perspective of gene functions;
- Get more information about a gene list;
- Discover what pathways are enriched in a gene list (and use it for hypothesis generation);
- Predict gene function and extend a gene list;
- Follow workflow after the workshop to conduct their own analysis.

### Target Audience

This workshop is intended for biologists working with ‘-Omics data’ (e.g. RNA-Seq, protein expression and other omics data), who are interested in interpreting large gene/protein lists resulting from their experiments.

### Setup Requirements

This workshop will be delivered online over zoom and slack; you may wish to install the dedicated zoom and slack applications. Otherwise, no special software installation will required, as we will be using online analysis tools.  

 * Zoom Link:  TBA
 * Slack Channel:

Links and material will be provided on the day. BYO coffee.
