## Functional analysis of -Omics data

Notes, to be removed

### Overview of enrichment methods
- Types
    - Gene list based
    - Rank Based
    - Network based
- Hypogeometric distribution and Fisher's exact test 
    - Over/under representation?
    - Background list
    - Select organism
    - Difference between database and tool and both
- What is GO? A tree.
- Other stats considerations:
    - Multiple hypothesis correction
    - Importance of background, what is it.
    - Effect of gene list size? What size do you need?

- The -log pval plot. (pull an example from literature?) 
- up genes / down genes => together or separate. (added)

### Hands on
- David
- Gprofiler
- Reactome
- Panther (maybe)
